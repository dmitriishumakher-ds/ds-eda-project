# Housing Market Structural Analysis – Buyer Positioning Study

## Project Objective

This project analyzes structural differences between the overall housing market,
the luxury segment, and a specific buyer persona (Jacob Phillips).

The goal is to:
- Identify key structural drivers of premium pricing
- Analyze geographic concentration of luxury properties
- Provide strategic recommendations for the client

The analysis is conducted from a strategic positioning perspective to determine whether the client represents a typical luxury buyer or an extreme premium sub-segment.

## Client Profile

### Jacob Phillips
- Unlimited budget
- 4+ bathrooms
- Large lot
- No waterfront preference

## Key Insights

1. Luxury properties are ~90% larger in median living area than the overall market.
2. Bathroom count acts as a strong structural separator across segments.
3. Premium properties are spatially clustered in a limited number of high-end zip codes.

## Client Recommendations

1. Focus search efforts in 98004, 98040, and 98112.
2. Prioritize interior space over marginal grade improvements.
3. Consider price-efficient premium zones for better value per square foot.
4. Given that ~64% of Jacob-matching properties fall within the luxury segment, budget flexibility is structurally required.
